# Notifications
!!!warning
These notifications may or may not be offered outside of the support server in the future.

## Managing Notifications
If you join the [support server](https://discord.gg/d2kKwqcUsv), you can choose to receive a notification every time a new announcement is posted.

In the [support server](https://discord.gg/d2kKwqcUsv), go to the [#notifications](https://discord.com/channels/838544983261839481/972978567136817252) channel. In that channel, press a button of your choosing to toggle notifications for that category of announcements.

## Global Notifications
Due to Discord limitations, the addition of notifications to every server would either be to:

- Send announcements to each server individually. This would increase APi calls to an unacceptable level and limit scalability.
- Listen to webhooks and sending pings based on them. This would probably look quite ugly and potentially unreliable, but is probably the best approach.

Regardless, each approach requires the bot to be in the server and requires more permissions. Due to these reasons, for now, this addition is not a priority.
