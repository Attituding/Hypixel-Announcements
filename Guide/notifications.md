# Notifications
!!!warning
These notifications may or may not be offered to servers other than the support server in the future.

## Managing Notifications
If you join the [support server](https://discord.gg/d2kKwqcUsv), you can choose to receive a notification every time a new announcement is posted.

In the [support server](https://discord.gg/d2kKwqcUsv), go to the [#notifications](https://discord.com/channels/838544983261839481/972978567136817252) channel. In that channel, press a button of your choosing to toggle notifications for that category of announcements.

## Global Notifications
Due to Discord limitations, the addition of notifications to every server would either be to:

- Send announcements to each server individually
- Listen to webhooks and sending pings based on them

Regardless, each approach requires the bot to be in the server, limits scalability, increases API calls, and requires more permissions. Due to these reasons, for now, this addition isn't feasible.
