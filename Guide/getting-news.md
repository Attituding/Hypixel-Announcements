# Getting News
To start getting your news, you can either choose to use the Discord Bot or choose to directly follow the announcement channels.

## Channel Following
Discord offers a neat feature where you can "follow" certain channels and have its messages be sent to your desired server + channel. To get Hypixel news using this method,
- Join [support server](https://discord.gg/d2kKwqcUsv)
- Navigate to the Hypixel News categories
- Find your desired announcement category
- Click the follow button at the top
- Choose your desired server and channel

and done! ðŸŽ‰
