## Adding Announcements
Use **/announcements** to configure what announcements to receive. Find the command that fits your needs.
- In order to select what category of announcement to add, select either **general**, **skyblock**, or **moderation**
- To add that type of announcement to a channel, use the **add** sub command.
- To pick what channel to send the announcements to, use the **channel** option.

For example, **/announcements general add #general** will add general announcements to the **#general** channel.

## Removing Announcements
To remove an announcement type, you can either
- Execute the same command you sued to set it up, but with **remove** instead of **add**
- Manually remove the webhook from the selected channel or server
