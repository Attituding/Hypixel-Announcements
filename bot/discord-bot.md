# Discord Bot
!!!success
This Discord bot is a way to easily manage announcements to your server. **You can always add announcements by directly following the announcement channels in the [support server](https://discord.gg/d2kKwqcUsv)**. In the future, this bot may be more useful with a notification system that pings you whenever a new announcement is posted.

## Invite
Invite the bot by clicking the invite below or clicking the link on the navigation menu, and then granting the OAuth2 scopes required. You may be prompted to provide a 2FA code.
